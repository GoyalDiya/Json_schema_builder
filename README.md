## Overview

The JSON Schema Builder is a developer tool designed to simplify the process of creating JSON schemas. Instead of writing complex schema definitions by hand, you can use this intuitive interface to dynamically add, nest, and define fields. The application provides an instant live preview of the generated JSON structure, ensuring accuracy and speeding up the development workflow.

This project was built to address the common challenge of writing and validating JSON schemas, offering a more visual and less error-prone alternative.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Form Generation:**
    *   Add or remove fields with a single click.
    *   Fields are managed using `react-hook-form` for optimal performance and state management.

*   **Nested Object Support:**
    *   Create complex, hierarchical JSON structures by adding nested fields within other fields.
    *   The UI visually represents nesting with indentation for clarity.

*   **Real-Time JSON Preview:**
    *   An interactive preview pane instantly reflects every change you make—from typing a field name to selecting its type.
    *   This ensures the generated schema is always in sync with your inputs.

*   **Type Safety:**
    *   Select from predefined types like `string`, `number`, or `nested` to ensure the schema is well-formed.
    *   New fields default to a sensible type to streamline the creation process.

*   **Modern Tech Stack:**
    *   **React:** For building a fast and component-based user interface.
    *   **React Hook Form:** For efficient and performant form state management.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, utility-first styling.
    *   **Vite:** As the next-generation frontend tooling for a blazing-fast development experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/json-schema-builder.git
    cd json-schema-builder
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite assigns) to see the application live.

## How to Use

*   **Add a Field:** Click the **"+ Add Item"** button to add a new field row to the form.
*   **Name a Field:** Type directly into the "Field name" input. The JSON preview will update as you type.
*   **Select a Type:** Use the "Field Type" dropdown to assign a data type. If you select `nested`, a new "Add Item" button will appear within that field to allow for nested objects.
*   **Remove a Field:** Click the `×` button to delete a field row.
*   **Submit:** The "Submit" button is included for form submission, though its `onSubmit` handler is currently empty and can be configured as needed.
